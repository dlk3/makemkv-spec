# Fedora RPM Packaged For makemkv

`makemkv` is a tool to rip and trandcode DVD and Blu-Ray disks to MKV
files.  See its [home page](https://www.makemkv.com) for details.

This repository contains a `makemkv.spec` file that helps me build
an installation RPM file for `makemkv` for my Fedora 30 desktop.  In 
addition, I posted the RPMs that I've built using this spec file in the
[Releases tab](https://github.com/dlk3/makemkv-spec/releases) of this
repository
